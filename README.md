# password-strength-checker
This project helps you check how strong a password is. It looks at things like how long the password is, what types of characters it uses, whether it repeats the same letters or patterns, and how random it is. After you enter a password, the program gives you a clear report that shows what’s good and what needs improvement. This makes it easy for anyone to understand if their password is safe enough.

You can use this project to test your own passwords, understand why a password is weak or strong, or build your own improved version of the checker. You can even combine it with other projects, like login pages or sign-up systems.
